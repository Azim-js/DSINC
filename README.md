## How to Run a C File

Follow these steps to compile and run a C file:

1. **Install a C Compiler**  
    Ensure you have a C compiler installed, such as `gcc`. You can install it using your package manager:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install gcc   # For Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo dnf install gcc       # For Fedora
    brew install gcc           # For macOS
    ```

2. **Compile the C File**  
    Use the `gcc` command to compile your C file. Replace `filename.c` with the name of your C file:
    ```bash
    gcc filename.c -o output
    ```

3. **Run the Compiled Program**  
    Execute the compiled program by running:
    ```bash
    ./output
    ```

4. **Example**  
    If you have a file named `example.c`, you can run it as follows:
    ```bash
    gcc example.c -o example
    ./example
    ```
